The game dynamically generates levels based on JSON data, where players match tiles of the same type (e.g., green, blue, red, yellow duck cubes) to complete objectives like destroying obstacles. Special tiles, such as TNT, explode to clear surrounding tiles, adding strategic depth. Core mechanics include matching tiles to score points, tile falling when tiles are removed, and special obstacles like Box Tiles. Each level has specific goals, and players progress through increasing difficulty. The game tracks progress using PlayerPrefs. The UI includes a main menu, loading screen, in-game display for moves and score, and popups for level completion or failure with options to continue or retry.
